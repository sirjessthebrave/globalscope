        Paulina emerges from her office - a baby blue building with ivy growing up the side in the hip Roma Norte neighborhood of Mexico City (CDMX). The sunny warm day checked in at 73 degrees F, it was December 7th, 2018 (yes, I said December 7… Mexico is the best). We greet each other and dash across the busy street to a tiny cafe, both the baristas know her by name. She introduces me as we order coffee and I chat with the man making our Americanos, he is from Buenos Aires and I am headed there soon. We joke that the accent will be hard for my minimal but growing Spanish abilities. Per usual they compliment by Spanish (I know they are lying but appreciate the kindness) and excuse themselves for their poor English (it’s great). Paulina and I take a seat outside, I marvel again at the aggressively pleasant weather in December

      <p class="drop-cap">Paulina is Director of Operations and Founder of Cívica Digital, a company which works on civic tech projects in Mexico. A graduate of the Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM or Monterrey Institute of Technology), Paulina considers herself a technologist first, but with a drive to use that tech to create communities and public services. She started in tech working for Microsoft in Seattle, WA on the XBOX video software.</p>

        She recalls how in 2012, after President Enrique Peña Nieto was elected and the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) returned to power, Paulina decided while she loves tech, she needed more social impact in her work. She returned to Mexico and helped create Codeando Mexico, a company working to bring tech solutions for public problems and the government.

            Mexico is home to about 130,000 people and more than 50% of Mexicans have access to the internet - however the quality and type of access vary on an urban/rural divide. Many Mexicans are accessing the internet through their cell phones - many of whose data plans charge for data (but often not Facebook!). Older generation phones, data usage, and low bandwidth, Paulina outlined for me, are issues that many folks outside the major cities contend with. This can mean that apps that use large amounts of storage, rely on fast internet, or do not work on mobile devices cannot be used. Following her time at Codeando Mexico, Paulina helped found an build her current organization, Cívica Digital. The goal is to make civic tech good tech!

        <p class="drop-cap">Good tech is first off, tech that works, she points out, and if your website can’t be used thought the ways that many Mexicans are accessing the internet it’s an issue!  She goes on to say that often, because of poor government websites and the free availability of Facebook, folks are contacting their government officials through Facebook messenger not government web services.  Paulina walks me through some of the most pressing issues in Mexico including access to public services, the environment and air quality, security and mobility. She shares that while the the government has been starting to provide data civic minded techies struggle with bad formats or data that is not relevant to modern issues.  For Paulina this represents opportunity for growth, and through her work she’s doing just that.</p>

          I ask Paulina what the general attitude and scene is here in Mexico City around tech, technologists, and those involved in tech for public good. One of the most active in Latin America, CDMX has a decent sized startup scene which often focuses on Fintech or services. Civic tech is a small but growing scene. She believes that Mexicans are creative and have been ‘hacking’ their government for some time. She also states that as a family focused country, Mexico has a strong sense of community. While there has been no ‘big bang’ type of civic tech activity, she has seen slow, steady growth - a sense of regaining the meaning, and control, of “public”.
